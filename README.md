# libGDX Open Dynamics Engine (ODE4J) - physics engine LIBRARY

![image](https://github.com/antzGames/gdx-ode4j/assets/10563814/c59c282d-9198-4066-81b7-0de4e5808f64)

This is a ODE4J library compatible with all libGDX backends, including GWT.  It is based on
version **0.5.1** of [Open Dynamics Engine for Java](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j).

If you want to use ODE4J only on libGDX Desktop/Android/iOS backends then I recommend you use [odej4](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j) directly.  
However if you want cross platform support (i.e include GWT support) then you need to use this library.

Currently this is the only 3D physics engine option for GWT on libGDX.

## How to use in your project

Add the dependency in your core project:

```gradle
project(":core") {
    ...

    dependencies {
        ...
          api "com.github.antzGames:ode4j:0.5.1"
    }
}
```

If you are targeting HTML (GWT) you will also need the following:

```gradle
project(":html") {
    ...
    dependencies {
        ...
        implementation "com.github.antzGames:ode4j:0.5.1:sources"
        implementation "com.github.tommyettinger:formic:0.1.4:sources"
    }
}
```

and lastly add this to your `GdxDefinition.gwt.xml` file:

```xml
<module>
    ...
    <inherits name="gdx_ode4j" />
    <inherits name="formic" />
    ...
</module>
```

## Runtime examples

Some examples can be found in my [https://github.com/antzGames/gdx-ode4j-examples](https://github.com/antzGames/gdx-ode4j-examples/tree/0.5.1_Demos) repository.

Or play with them on [itch.io](https://antzgames.itch.io/physics-in-a-browser).

https://github.com/antzGames/gdx-ode4j/assets/10563814/bc46a9a9-f2e8-414b-bfde-8be6ea54e46b

## Math classes

Ode4j has its own math classes similar to libGDX's Vector3, Matrix3, Matrix4, and Quaternion.

I added a math utility class called [Ode2GDXMathUtils](https://github.com/antzGames/gdx-ode4j/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/antzGames/gdx/ode4j/Ode2GdxMathUtils.java).  Use the following methods to create the libGDX Quaternion from ode4j's QuanternionC or DMatrix3C:

```java
    Quaternion q1 = Ode2GdxMathUtils.getGdxQuaternion(odeQuaternion);  
    Quaternion q2 = Ode2GdxMathUtils.getGdxQuaternion(odeMat3);
```

In addition ode4j uses double and not float like most of libGDX's math classes.

## Limitations

### Fixed timesteps

ODE was made to work with fixed timesteps.  Do not pass `Gdx.graphics.getDeltaTime()` to `world.quickStep()`.

The following online [ODE HOWTO entry](https://ode.org/wiki/index.php/HOWTO_fixed_vs_variable_timestep) discusses how to incorporate this limitation into a game.

Using `vsync=true` in your game launch configuration helps, but some people might run at 60hz, while others might run at 50Hz, 75Hz, 144Hz.
This means that objects will fall/interact at different speeds on these different refresh rates.

Below is example code that you can use to force physics to only update at a fixed interval (timestep).

```java
public static final float MIN_FRAME_LENGTH = 1f/60f;
        ...

@Override
public void render(float deltaTime){
        timeSinceLastRender += deltaTime;

        // Only compute 60Hz for physics
        if (timeSinceLastRender >= MIN_FRAME_LENGTH) {
            odePhysicsSystem.update(MIN_FRAME_LENGTH);   // My custom class, which eventaully calls world.quickStep(MIN_FRAME_LENGTH)
            timeSinceLastRender -= MIN_FRAME_LENGTH;

            if(timeSinceLastRender > MIN_FRAME_LENGTH)
                timeSinceLastRender = 0;
        }

        ...
}
```

### Performance

I have tried jBullet, PhysX and ODE physics engines with libGDX.  ODE is the slowest, and the reason being is that in ODE everything is using double precision.

## Where to get ODE/ode4j documentation and help

ODE official manual: http://ode.org/wiki/index.php/Manual

By far the most useful part is the [HOWTO](http://ode.org/wiki/index.php/HOWTO) section

ode4j discord channel : https://discord.gg/UFXJcXv2P8 ode4j/Java

ode4j contains also some features that are not present in ODE, such as a ragdoll and heightfields with holes. See ode4j's [Wiki](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/wiki/Functionality-beyond-ODE).

The [ODE forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ode-users) is useful for questions around physics and general API usage.

The [ode4j forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/ode4j) is for problems and functionality specific to ode4j/Java.

There is also the [old website](https://tzaeschke.github.io/ode4j-old/), including some [screenshots](https://tzaeschke.github.io/ode4j-old/ode4j-features.html).

Here is a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENlpu_Jjp3Q) of a list of games that used ODE from 2002-2015.  You will be suprised how many of your favorite games used this physcis libary.

## Versions

Both ODE4J `v0.4.1` and `v0.5.1` have been ported.

# ode4j

![Java 8](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/actions/workflows/build-java-8.yml/badge.svg)
![Java 9+](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/actions/workflows/build-java-9-plus.yml/badge.svg)

ode4j is a Java port of [ODE](http://www.ode.org/).

ODE is an open source, high performance library for simulating rigid body dynamics. It is fully featured, stable, mature
and platform independent with an easy to use C/C++ API. It has advanced joint types and integrated collision detection
with friction. ODE is useful for simulating vehicles, objects in virtual reality environments and virtual creatures.

The latest released version of ode4j is 0.5.3, but the master branch may contain fixes and improvements. Release 0.5.0
contains all changes up to ODE 0.16.3.

2017-10-06: Release of ode4j 0.3.1

* Numerous bugfixes and improvement, see CHANGELOG
* This is the last release built with Java 6.

## Project overview

* The "core" package contains the main library code. The public API is in:
    * `org.ode4j.math`
    * `org.ode4j.ode`
    * `org.ode4j.ode.ragdoll`

  All other packages are "internal" and should normally not be used.

* The "demo" package contains demo application for various simulation problems.
  The package contains the "drawstuff" library which is handy for visualizing simple
  physics simulation but should not be used for real applications (it is slow and clunky). Please
  use proper library such as [lwjgl](https://www.lwjgl.org/) for your own games or simulations.

* The "core-cpp" and "demo-cpp" packages are legacy packages and should be ignored.

## General recommendations

* Please use `DWorld.quickStep(...)` instead of `DWorld.step()`. The latter is slower and appears to be less stable.
* Consider disabling geometries that do not move. For an example, refer to [`DemoCrash`](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/blob/28a8338abccaccf13042e825ef615e0037aa91d3/demo/src/main/java/org/ode4j/demo/DemoCrash.java#L590).
The demo disables boxes that have not moved for a few steps. If a whole "island" of bodies is disabled, it is automatically excluded from simulation (bodies are automatically re-enabled when necessary), see also [ODE wiki](http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Islands_and_Disabled_Bodies).
* Set `OdeConfig.dDEBUG = true` for debugging and `= false` for best performance.
* When compiling with JDK 9 or later, `mvn` will automatically use the`on-jdk-9-plus` profile and create modules.
* In case of GC problems (e.g. on Android):
  There may be excessive garbage collection due to frequent allocation of `DContact` objects.
  To avoid this, these objects can be nullified and reused. See `PerfCards.nearCallback()` for an example.

## ODE vs od4j

While ode4j is a pretty literal port from ODE, there are some considerable differences
(besides one being Java and the other being C++). Some differences concern the API, others
are mostly internal.

### ode4j supported ODE features

* ode4j ist mostly similar to ODE when compiling ODE with
  `./configure --enable-double-precision --with-trimesh=gimpact --enable-libccd`. That means:
    * ode4j uses `double` precision throughout
    * ode4j supports only `GIMPACT` trimeshes, `OPCODE` is not supported
    * ode4j always uses `libccd` for collisions
* ode4j has multithreading support (ODE's "island" solver), however, ode4j does not support
  ODE's cooperative solver.
* ode4j has no special memory management (ODE has a "memory arena" concept).

### Additional features in ode4j

ode4j contains some custom features that are not present in ODE (see
also [Wiki](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/wiki/Functionality-beyond-ODE)):

* `DRagdoll` & `DConstrainedBallJoint`, 
  [see `DemoRagdoll`](demo/src/main/java/org/ode4j/demo/ragdoll/DemoRagdoll.java) and
  [`DemoJointConstrainedBall`](demo/src/main/java/org/ode4j/demo/DemoJointConstrainedBall.java).
* `DTrimeshHeightfield` with support for holes. 
  [See `DemoTrimeshHeightfield`](demo/src/main/java/org/ode4j/demo/DemoTrimeshHeightfield.java).
* Improved SAP space (`SapSpace2`) implementation that allows labelling bodies as "immobile",
  [see `SpacePerformanceTest`](core/src/test/java/org/ode4j/benchmarks/SpacePerformanceTest.java).
* BVH space based on a bounding volume hierarchy index,
  [see `SpacePerformanceTest`](core/src/test/java/org/ode4j/benchmarks/SpacePerformanceTest.java).
* Java multi-threading support, 
  [see `DemoMultithreading`](demo/src/main/java/org/ode4j/demo/ragdoll/DemoMultithreading.java).

### ode4j API vs ODE API

ode4j's API is very similar to ODE's API, so most tutorials / demos should be easily translatable.
However, there are some notable differences:

* Almost all objects in ode4j are created via the `OdeHelper` class.
* Math functions are located in `ode4j.math` and `OdeMath`. ode4j has different versions for some math objects,
  e.g. `DVector3` and `DVector3C` where the trailing `C` indicates an immutable or **C**onst version of the object.
* Class names in ode4j start with `D` instead of `d` in ODE. `d...ID` classes have been removed,
  use `d...` instead, e.g. `dBodyID` becomes `DBody`.
* ODE uses almost exclusively static methods. ode4j uses instead methods on objects where possible and
  methods have been renamed accordingly and their signature changed. Some examples:
    * `dGeomSetRotation(geom, ...)` becomes `geom.setRotation(...)`
    * `dJointSetHingeAxis(hingeJoint, ...)` becomes `hingeJoint.setAxis(...)`

  Many ODE methods have a `skip` parameter, this has been removed in ode4j.
* `dCollide` becomes `OdeHelper.collide()` and takes as argument a `DContactGeomBuffer`.
  This can be created via:
   ```
   DContactBuffer contacts = new DContactBuffer(MAX_CONTACTS); 
   OdeHelper.collide (o1, o2, MAX_CONTACTS, contacts.getGeomBuffer());
   ```
* Many classes have a "DESTRUCTOR" that replicates some C++ features, however this can usually
  be ignored.

### ode4j internal differences

* ode4j's DLCP uses `ROWPTRS = false`
* SAP-Space uses different merge-sort instead of radix-sort
* ...

### Version overview

ode4j versions and corresponding ODE versions:

* ode4j 0.5.0 contains all changes up to ODE 0.16.3.
* ode4j 0.4.0 contains most changes between 0.13.1 and 0.16.0.
* ode4j 0.3.1 is a port of ODE 0.13.1.
* ode4j 0.2.4 up to 0.2.9 are ports of ODE 0.12.1
