Migration to 0.13.1

New:
-- 3 new joints: DoubleBall, DoubleHinge, Transmission
-- New demos: DoubleBall, DoubleHinge, Gyro2, RFriction, Transmission
-- Multithreading (well...)

Done:
-- main code
-- tests 
-- demos
-- Fixed bug in dMatrix3Inv() --> Calculation was incorrect
-- Fixed bug in DObject --> destroying joints might have crashed
-- Fixed bug: Calling destroy() on a space with a Heightfield cause hang. 
-- Removed GeomTransform and other deprecated stuff
-- Java 1.6 again
-- Now passes strict -Xlint:all / -Werror builds

Demos:
- DemoBoxstack has MT disabled.

TODO
-- DemoPlane2 explodes...

Missing:
-- Multithreading does not work
-- Check further:
  -- DxWorldProcessMemArena.FreeMemArena --> Commented out
  -- DxWorldProcessContext.FreeArenasList --> Commented out
  -- ThreadingUtils.java 154-156
-- check matrix.h
-- Skipped: odeou.*, odetls.*
