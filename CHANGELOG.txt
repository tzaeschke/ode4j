TODO for 0.5.0
==============
- libGWT compatibility?
- CI
- add default logger, see ZooDB?
- Java 9/10/11 ?
- Beautify CHANGELOG -> .md
- Issue #22
- Cleanup GimMath / GimGeometry  (e.g. remove RefFloat)
- Move non-cpp tests out of cpp
- Move to Google Java Code Style
- Check commented out tests in surefire-plugin
- Check logged errors when running
  - DemoPlane2d
  - TestIssue0031_RagdollNPE
- Fix maven warnings:
  - "Split package, multiple jars provide the same package"
  - [WARNING] bootstrap class path not set in conjunction with -source 8
    when using: mvn clean install -P on-jdk-9-plus
- CI: Fail build on warnbing?!
- CI: remove "temurin"...?!


--> See TODO.txt

Check:
- Demo -> Test?  E.g. DemoI? DemoSpace(-Stress)? DemoStep? ....
- DemoPlane2D / DemoBasket(-Convex)
- Performance with DemoCards -> "TODO CHECK-TZ" in steppers


ODE2: DemoCard with 18 layers: Very weird, collapses slowly, some cards floating horizontally...
ODE16.2: Much better. Floating card is actually fine (in theory). But3rd row collapses and
 after a while, the outer card stops in a weird place.

- Issue #22 / ODE issue #36: https://bitbucket.org/odedevs/ode/issues/36/fix-gimpact-contacts-handling
  This has been resolved, We need to remove the workaround in OdeConfig::50
// TODO TZ check
// TODO TZ fix
// TODO CHECK-TZ


0.5.0 (unreleased)
=====
- Port updates until 0.16.2.
  THis includes some libCCD updates missing fro the 0.15.1 update.
  TODO FIX prism dependency in ColliksionTest.test_collision_ray_convex()
  Not ported:
  - resource_control.*
  - simple_cooperation.*
  - Updates to DxWorldProcessContext
  - threaded_solver.ldlt.h

  DONE: backwards up until quickstep.cpp

- Added GutHub Actions CI builds for Java 8 and 9. [#95](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/pull/95)
- Added default logger for demos and tests. [#94](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/pull/94)
- Added Android API compliance checker, now for API level 24 (the lowest that ode4j passed without changes)
  [#93](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/pull/93)
- Updated maven dependencies [#92](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/pull/92)
- Test that internal assertions did not throw Exceptions. This was fixed as part of #86.
  [#74](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/issues/74)
- Fixes to LWJGL 3.0 [#91](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/pull/91)
- Moved to LWJGL 3.0 [#89](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/issues/89)
- Move to Java [#87](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/issues/87)
  (Cleanup, part of this was done with the move to 0.15.1)
- Update to ODE 0.15.1 [#86](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/pull/86)
  - This includes increased stability, e.g. the DemoCards won't collapse anymore when 30 levels high.
  - **** WARNING **** : Still missing: trimesh collider updates.
- Changed CI build requirements:
  - Removed openjdk7: Not required. source compatibility is still set to 7, but should
    be safe to change to 8 now (Android Nougat is mostly 8 compatible), this covers > 80% users.
  - Changed oraclejdk build to 11
