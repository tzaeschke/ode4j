/**
 * The world object is a container for rigid bodies and joints. Objects in
 * different worlds can not interact, for example rigid bodies from two
 * different worlds can not collide.
 * <p>
 * All the objects in a world exist at the same point in time, thus one
 * reason to use separate worlds is to simulate systems at different rates.
 * Most applications will only need one world.
 * 
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Automatic Enabling and Disabling</b>
 * <p>
 * Every body can be enabled or disabled. Enabled bodies participate in the
 * simulation, while disabled bodies are turned off and do not get updated
 * during a simulation step. New bodies are always created in the enabled state.
 * <p>
 * A disabled body that is connected through a joint to an enabled body will be
 * automatically re-enabled at the next simulation step.
 * <p>
 * Disabled bodies do not consume CPU time, therefore to speed up the simulation
 * bodies should be disabled when they come to rest. This can be done automatically
 * with the auto-disable feature.
 * <p>
 * If a body has its auto-disable flag turned on, it will automatically disable
 * itself when
 * <ul>
 *   <li> It has been idle for a given number of simulation steps.</li>
 *   <li> It has also been idle for a given amount of simulation time.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A body is considered to be idle when the magnitudes of both its
 * linear average velocity and angular average velocity are below given thresholds.
 * The sample size for the average defaults to one and can be disabled by setting
 * to zero with
 * <p>
 * Thus, every body has six auto-disable parameters: an enabled flag, a idle step
 * count, an idle time, linear/angular average velocity thresholds, and the
 * average samples count.
 * <p>
 * Newly created bodies get these parameters from world.
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * <b>Damping</b><br>
 * <p>
 * Damping serves two purposes: reduce simulation instability, and to allow
 * the bodies to come to rest (and possibly auto-disabling them).
 * <p>
 * Bodies are constructed using the world's current damping parameters. Setting
 * the scales to 0 disables the damping.
 * <p>
 * Here is how it is done: after every time step linear and angular
 * velocities are tested against the corresponding thresholds. If they
 * are above, they are multiplied by (1 - scale). So a negative scale value
 * will actually increase the speed, and values greater than one will
 * make the object oscillate every step; both can make the simulation unstable.
 * <p>
 * To disable damping just set the damping scale to zero.
 * <p>
 * You can also limit the maximum angular velocity. In contrast to the damping
 * functions, the angular velocity is affected before the body is moved.
 * This means that it will introduce errors in joints that are forcing the body
 * to rotate too fast. Some bodies have naturally high angular velocities
 * (like cars' wheels), so you may want to give them a very high (like the default,
 * dInfinity) limit.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: The velocities are damped after the stepper function has moved the
 * object. Otherwise the damping could introduce errors in joints. First the
 * joint constraints are processed by the stepper (moving the body), then
 * the damping is applied.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: The damping happens right after the moved callback is called; this way
 * it still possible use the exact velocities the body has acquired during the
 * step. You can even use the callback to create your own customized damping.
