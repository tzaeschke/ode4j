July 6th 2009:
Some minor things I found in the code:
- The test universal.cpp (587-593) is probably incorrectly checking the first field of the array 3 times, rather than checking the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd field.
- demo_gyroscopic is not initializing 'contactgroup'
- demo_kinematic is not initializing 'joints'
- demo_moving_convex uses dWorldStepFast1, which is deprecated:
- dJointAddPUTorque (...) : Can anyone point me to the implementation? I don't think there is one.
- http://opende.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Joint_Param_Documentation
  This indicate that PU & PR joint have not parameters, I don't think that's correct?
- GeomTransform is obsolete since 0.6 (according to the Wiki), but it is still used in several demos:
  deom_boxstack, demo_heightfield, demo_jointPU, demo_motion, demo_spacestress.
  I haven't used it myself, so is it still required?


REPORT MISSING:
- dBody.destroy()
- dCapsule class
- dPlane2DJoint class
- dMass.setCylinder in OO-API
- dMass.setSphereTotal in OO-API
- dMass.check()
- dWorld.void setAutoDisableAverageSamplesCount(int average_samples_count)
- dWorld.void setContactMaxCorrectingVel (double vel);
- dWorld.destroy()
- dJointGroup.destroy()
- dGeom.setOffsetPosition()
- dGeom.setOffsetRotation()
- dGeomTransform API class
- dPistonJoint.setAnchorOffset()


REPORT !!!!
- Report that SAP-Space BoxPruning may miss some collisions:
  while ( poslist[*RunningAddress++] < poslist[IndexPair.id0] ) {}
  This line increases the RunningAddress to the first that is not
  smaller PLUS ONE!!  DONE (2009-05-08)
  

FIX !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- dArray.push() clones Objects!!!!!!!


DOC:
- replace @sa with @see
- replace \li with <li>

dJointGetAMotorNumAxes: Unused @param 'num'
dJointGetAMotorAxis: Unused @param 'rel'
dJointGetAMotorMode: Unused @param 'mode'


DIFFERENCES:
- No GIMPACT/OPCODE, only Heightfield
- SAP-Space uses different implementation (merge-sort i.o. radix-sort)
- DrawStuff is slow. The implementation would require significant changes to 
  be a fast as the C/C++ version.
- The OO-API is the main API. The static CCP-like API is only available to
  simplify porting.
- A custom cpp2java library is used for porting the code.
- Much of the math has been moved to a separate package. dVector3 and their 
  like now provide much own functionality.
- The test harnesses now partly use JUnit 4, instead of the C/C++ test library.   
- TLS Thread Local Storage has not been ported. Most likely, there is no need to
  port this.
- The Java implementation is 'thread-tolerant' (CORRECT TERM???) by avoiding  
  any static variables. 
  That means it should be possible to process different dWorlds in parallel,
  and possibly even multiple spaces in parallel, if the dWorld is not modified (verify!).
- Contrary to the policy in C/C++ ODE, I prefer in Java return immutable DVectors when
  calling getXXX(), rather than having to pass in a DVector to be overwritten. The
  reasons are partly specific to Java:
  - Returning an immutable is very straight forward using an immutable interface
  - I may avoid unnecessary object creation if the returned value is only used briefly
    and only for reading
  - It avoid possibly fatal typos, because getter and setter are distinguished by signature,
    not only by one letter: dGeomGetPos(g,p) / dGeomSetPos(g,p) --> p = g.getPos() / get.setPos(p)
  - Above that, I think it is normal coding practice in Java to return a value if a method has only
    one result.
  * On the other hand, this can cause problems, because the "immutable' Object may be modified
    while it is used, either through multithreading, or simply by other calls to the Object.
  * Also, it may NOT be modified, because the user does not know whether he gets an actual field
    or only a calculated result back.

REQUIRED LIBS:
- Java 6: for everything.
- cppLib: for everything. It is used to simplify the porting. It is currently
  included in the ode4j jars.
- JUnit 4: for the test harnesses
- lwjgl 2.0.1: for DrawStuff



Cleanup uses of dVector.v, especially in e.g.
- dxBody
- dxJoint

dxPlane._p -> Change from double[4] to dVector3?

Check and remove references (and commented out occurrences) of:
- dSetZero()

- Try to avoid dPAD()


Remove commented out references to dUSE_MALLOC_FOR_ALLOCA


CPP API should not use internal classes ?!?!?!? Also avoid casting !!!!!
-> Call DJoint j; j.getXY()

TODO
- DOC: @sa -> @see
- DOC: @li -> <li>
- change DxJoint node[0]/[1] to _node0/_node1
- Use ThreadLocal DVector3 Pool to avoid synchronization?
- DEMO: remove references to CPP4J
- Implement auto-allocation of dContacts.
  dContactGeom() -> auto alloc
  dContactGeom(10) -> alloc w/ fixed limit
  dContactGeom(10, bFixed) -> (auto-)alloc w/ bFixed limit
- Test for thread-tolerance!! No static !?!!?!!
- performance: dxGeom should use LinkedIdentityHashSet(?)! (spaceRemove())
  --> Update QuadTreeSpace accordingly!
- TRIMESH et al. Make Colliders to singletons, avoid instantiation in dxHeightfield
- disable DEBUG modes
- replace concatenated dVector math with specific methods, remove set() calls
- replace methods that take x,y,z with ones that take dVector3
- PerfTest and replace 'double[] v' in dVector3 with 'double v0, v1, v2;'
- get rid of all _tome stuff and firstjoint/firstbody
- Check that 'unsigned' is always assigned with fabs(y); !!!
- rename all classes to have capital 'D'?
- Check that org.ode4j.ode.* does not reference org.ode4j.cpp  !!!
- Check that org.ode4j.ode.* does not reference org.ode4j.*.internal.*  ?!?
- Check that org.ode4j.demo.* does not reference org.ode4j.*.internal.*  ?!!
- Get rid of Thread stuff in API_OdeInit / OdeInit (?)
- rename add/sum/setDiff to eqAdd(?)/eqSum/eqDiff
- rename xxx to retSum/retDiff
- deprecate RefDouble in APIs!!
- Think about Radix-sort in SAP SPACE
- In SAP SPACE, use sort for all three dimensions and then prune Pairs
  that are not in all Dimensions?

Trimesh:
--------
- Heigthfield has bug (see post on March 10), use Trimesh instead
- OPCODE is default over GIMPACT. There is also OPCODE-NEW (see WIKI)

Bigger plans:
-------------
- Heightfield
- Migrate javadoc from API to dBody, dContact, ... classes
- Migrate one (or both?) of the TRIMESH libraries
- Split ObjAPI and CppAPI into different packages
- Make ObjAPI and Internals independent of CppAPI:
  - No references to dClassID
  - No references to org.tz.cpp
- math independent of the rest
- Check for multithreaded abilities.
- Investigate AtomicXXX libraries
- Implement GJK algorithm, see: 
	http://opende.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/How_Collision_Detection_Works
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi_distance_algorithm

- use dVector3 as param instead of 3*double, e.g.:
	dGeomBoxSetLengths, dGeomSetPosition, dGeomBoxPointDepth,
	dGeomSpherePointDepth, dGeomPlaneSetParams, dGeomPlanePointDepth
	dGeomCapsuleSetParams, dGeomCapsulePointDepth, dGeomRaySet
	
- parallel:
  - collision detection (one collision per thread
  - SAP space: sort objects in three dimensions in three Threads.
  - LPC --> This will be more complicated, I guess.

-------------------
Migration guide
-------------------
 
Use QuickStep. Its's faster then Step. StepFast has not been migrated (or has it?)
  
  
dMass
=====
- dMass._c is now a dVector3, but was a dVector4


ID
==
d...ID classes have been removed, use d... instead.
The d...ID.id() method, that used to return the backing object is not necessary
anymore, because the user is always dealing with the actual objects.


OdeHelper
=========
Instead of 'new', Ode onjects have to be created via the static methods in OdeHelper.


dCollide arguments / dContact / dContactGeom / dColliderFn
==========================================================
- dCollide takes as argument a dContactGeomBuffer(). This can be created via:
  dContactBuffer contacts = new dContactBuffer(MAX_CONTACTS);
  dCollide( ...., contacts.getGeomBuffer() );
  This was necessary to allow it being filled with new contacts.
- Parameter skip got removed. It is assumed that it was always size(dContact)
  and is now assumed to be '1' (always going to the following contact).



useful imports:
===============
import static org.ode4j.drawstuff.DS_API.*;
import static org.ode4j.cpp.OdeCpp.*;
import static org.ode4j.ode.OdeMath.*;
import static org.cpp4j.C_All.*;
DS_API is useful for demos
OdeCpp is the 1to1 implementation of the C API of ODE
OdeCppMath is the 1to1 implementation of the C math API of ODE
C_All is useful when migrating C/C++ code to Java (e.g. demos and tests from ODE) 


Using DrawStuff callbacks:
==========================
    class MyDemo extends dsFunctions { ...

	main(String args) {
		// setup pointers to drawstuff callback functions
		dsFunctions fn = new MyDemo();
		fn.version = DS_VERSION;
		//  fn.start = &start;
		//  fn.step = &simLoop;
		//  fn.command = &command;
		//  fn.stop = 0;
		fn.path_to_textures = DRAWSTUFF_TEXTURE_PATH;

So MyDemo should implement dsFunctions, the implemented methods should
call the local equivalents.
Note that command(char c) now take a 'char' and step(boolean pause) takes
a 'boolean' argument.


dGeom.getClass() was renamed to dGeom.getClassID()
dGeom.id() has been removed.
dGeom.isSpace() has been removed.
dGeom.DESTRUCTOR added.

dBody.create() has been removed:
    body = dBodyCreate(world);//  body.create (world);


dGeomGetClass / type
====================
the getType() methods have been removed.
//if (dGeomGetClass (g) == dPlaneClass) {
  if (g instanceof dPlane) {
  

Joint parameters
================
joint.setParam (dParamVel, vel);
-->
joint.setParam (D_PARAM_NAMES_N.dParamVel1, vel);


dContact
========
  dContact contact[N];
  int n = dCollide (o1,o2,N,&(contact[0].geom),sizeof(dContact));
  contact[i].xxx
-->
  dContactBuffer contacts = new dContactBuffer(N);
  int n = dCollide (o1,o2,N,contacts.getGeomBuffer());
  contacts.get(i).xxx
  
- CONTACT(dContactGeom* p, int skip)
  deprecated, instead, please use: dContagGeomBuffer.get(skip);

  
 nearCallback
 ============
 Add the following:
 	private dNearCallback nearCallback = new dNearCallback() {
		@Override
		public void call(Object data, dGeom o1, dGeom o2) {
			nearCallback(data, o1, o2);
		}
	};
 

Class types
===========
dSphereClass
-->
dGeom.dSphereClass
or BETTER:
instanceof DSphere
  
dJointTypeContact
-->
Common.dJointType.dJointTypeContact


ContactType -> Find better name
===========

if (b1!=null && b2!=null && dAreConnectedExcluding(b1, b2, dJointTypeContact))
    return;
-->
if (b1!=null && b2!=null && OdeHelper.areConnectedExcluding(b1, b2, DContactJoint.class))
    return;



Constants
=========
Constants are in OdeConstants
- dInfinity
- dContact*



Other
=====
dJointGroupCreate (1000000);
OdeHelper.createJointGroup (100000);
----> The parameter has been deprecated. Set to 0.

dInitODE2(0);
---> OdeHelper.initODE2(0);

dCloseODE();
---> OdeHelper.closeODE();



DAABB
=====
DVector6 is replaced by DAABB/DAABBC
